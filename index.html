        <h1>WOLF</h1>
    </header>

  <p>Any person who has been able to catch a glimpse of any type of wolf is indeed a lucky man. The wolf is one of 
    the earth’s mostcowardly and fearful animals, and it is so sly and, pardon the expression, foxy, that it is almost
     a waste of time to try and catch him in any kind of trap. Although he can be cowardly and fearful, he can also be 
     one the most vicious and blood-thirsty of all animals. Wolves are among some of the world’s smartest and most 
     perceptive mammals.

  <p>The wolves usually travel during the night times or in the cool temperatures during dawn and dusk. They usually travel
    at an average speed close to five miles per hour, but they can run up to 25 miles per hour. Wolves, like most canids, are 
    digitigrade with five toes on front feet and four on hind feet. They are equipped with short, thick claws that give them 
    good traction for running. Wolves are very well-equipped for the hunt. They have 42 teeth that are backed up by incredibly
     strong jaw muscles. They usually can track their prey with their keen sense of smell that, if downwind, can detect prey at 
     up to around 300 yards.  An interesting aspect in the manner in which wolves is what is known as the “conversation of death.”
      Wolves often test large prey, and in approaching whatever this might be, a moose, caribou, elk, or bison, they engage their prey’s
       gaze with a sober stare. Man has not been able to translate this “phenomenon” any more than he has been able to translate the meaning
     and significance of howling. However, it has been suggested that with this momentary, silent communication it is decided whether the hunt
      will be stopped or if a chase will follow.
